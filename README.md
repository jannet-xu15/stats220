# stats220
## Welcome!

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

**A little about me:**
- I am undertaking a degree in *Computer Science*.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I'm interested in other languages of coding.
- I am interested in learning about R Code and utilising it for stats.

**Things I enjoy doing:**
1. Playing games
2. Eating
3. ***Hanging out with friends***

One of my favourite cartoon characters is **Snoopy**
